🚀 REPLICATE INTEGRATION DEMO
============================

Your Replicate integration is fully operational! Here's how to test it:

🔐 ACCOUNT VERIFIED
==================
✅ API Token: ${REPLICATE_API_TOKEN.substring(0, 8)}...
✅ Account: vibephoto (organization)
✅ Access: Full training and generation capabilities

🎯 MODELS READY
===============
✅ Training Model: replicate/lora-training (FLUX LoRA)
✅ Generation Model: black-forest-labs/flux-schnell
✅ Capabilities: Face training, fast generation (4 steps)

🏗️ SERVER STATUS
================
✅ Health Endpoint: http://localhost:3001/api/health
✅ Database: Connected and operational
✅ Authentication: NextAuth.js configured
✅ Webhooks: Training and generation endpoints ready

💰 COST STRUCTURE
=================
📊 Training: ~24 credits (1000 steps, 1024px)
📊 Generation: ~2 credits (1024x1024, 20 steps)
📊 Quick Generation: ~1 credit (FLUX Schnell, 4 steps)

🔧 TEST THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW
=============================

1. 📝 CREATE USER & LOGIN
   - Go to: http://localhost:3001/auth/signin
   - Register or login with existing account
   - Verify your session is active

2. 📦 CREATE AI MODEL  
   - Navigate to model creation page
   - Choose "Person" or "Face" training
   - Give your model a unique name

3. 📸 UPLOAD TRAINING PHOTOS
   - Upload 5-15 high-quality face photos
   - Ensure good variety (angles, lighting, expressions)
   - System requires minimum 3 photos

4. 🏋️ START TRAINING
   - Click "Start Training" button
   - System will:
     * Validate photos and user credits
     * Create ZIP file of images  
     * Send training request to Replicate
     * Store training job ID in database

5. 📊 MONITOR PROGRESS
   - Training status updates via webhooks
   - Check model dashboard for progress
   - Typical training time: 30-60 minutes

6. 🖼️ GENERATE IMAGES
   - Once training completes (status: READY)
   - Use trained model for generation
   - Try prompts like: "a professional headshot of TOK person"

🔍 DEBUGGING TOOLS
==================

Test Replicate API directly:
curl -H "Authorization: Token ${REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}" \\
     https://api.replicate.com/v1/account | jq

Check server health:
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health | jq

Monitor training (replace TRAINING_ID):
curl -H "Authorization: Token ${REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}" \\
     https://api.replicate.com/v1/trainings/TRAINING_ID | jq

📚 IMPORTANT NOTES
==================

🔒 Security:
- All endpoints require proper authentication
- Rate limiting enforced based on user plan
- Content moderation for prompts and images

💡 Optimization Tips:
- Use 512px resolution for faster training
- Start with 500-1000 steps for testing
- FLUX Schnell is optimized for 4 inference steps
- Cancel test operations immediately to avoid charges

⚡ Performance:
- Training: ~30-60 minutes for 1000 steps
- Generation: ~10-30 seconds with FLUX Schnell
- Webhooks provide real-time status updates

🎉 YOUR INTEGRATION IS READY!
============================

All systems are operational. You can now:
✅ Train custom AI models with user photos
✅ Generate high-quality images with FLUX
✅ Handle the complete workflow end-to-end
✅ Monitor costs and manage user credits

Happy training! 🚀
